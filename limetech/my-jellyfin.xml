  <Overview>DESCRIPTION&#xD;
This docker template is based on the official Jellyfin image (jellyfin/jellyfin), without modifications. Just in case you wanna try it and compare to the other ones available.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jellyfin is the volunteer-built media solution that puts you in control of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no strings attached. Your media, your server, your way.&#xD;
&#xD;
Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it. We welcome anyone who is interested in joining us in our quest!&#xD;
&#xD;
NOTES&#xD;
&#x2022; Native images (this case) not always are the best options. Other ones could have specific modifications that adds some features not yet implemented on the official, for example: 'linuxserver/jellyfin', which supports HW acceleration for installation in other plataforms, like: ARM devices. The final decsion is only yours.&#xD;
&#x2022; It's recommended to set all the library paths to 'Read Only' permission, just for security reasons. But, it's up to you.&#xD;
&#x2022; There are no predefined library paths that must be set to allow Jellyfin to detect media content, and there's no limit for the number of them. The user can create as many paths as libraries it could have to best organize the media.&#xD;
